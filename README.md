# AutoHotkey script for selling steam cards

This is a simple [AutoHotkey](http://ahkscript.org/) script that helps you sell your STEAM cards. It doesn't automate the process nor figures our the price for you.

You have to press one button (or a combination of them) that represents the price you want and the script will send the keyboard strokes needed to input the price and click on the the **THREE** confirmation buttons that Steam requires. Unfortunately, you still need to confirm the transactions on the mobile app.
